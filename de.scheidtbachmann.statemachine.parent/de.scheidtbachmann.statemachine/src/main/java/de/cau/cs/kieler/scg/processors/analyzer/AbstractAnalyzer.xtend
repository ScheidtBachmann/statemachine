/** 
 * This class is part of the SCG transformation chain. In particular analyzers are called by the scheduler
 * before it is creating the schedule for an SCG. Alternatively, an analyzer may be called manually during 
 * any phase of the transformation process.
 * This abstract class defines the generic interface of an analyzer 
 * since the scheduler may choose different analyzers for different tasks.<br>
 * The chain is used to gather important information 
 * about the schedulability of a given SCG. This is done in several key steps. Between two steps the results 
 * are cached in specifically designed metamodels for further processing. At the end of the transformation
 * chain a newly generated (and sequentialized) SCG is returned. <br>
 * You can either call the transformations manually or use the SCG transformation extensions to enrich the
 * SCGs with the desired information.<br>
